# VBiTraining
Materials for the Vectorbite Training workshops

----
The tentative plan is:
* *Population abundance data analyses:* These will use VecDyn data
  - Fit statistical models (time series analyses)
  - Fit population dynamics models
  - Analyses in the spatial domain as well?

* *Trait data*: These will use VecTraits data
  - Fit traits data to mechanistic and statistical models
