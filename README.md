# VBiTraining
Materials for the Vectorbite Training workshops

----
The tentative plan is:

* *Probability, Statisics, and R background* - two tracks (beginner and intermediate/advanced)
  - Intro to R (b)
  - Probability distributions and likelihoods (b/a)
  - Basics of Bayesian Statistics using JAGS (a)
  
* *Trait data*: These will use VecTraits data
  - Fit trait data to mechanistic and statistical models
    * linear models/regression for simple trait models (a)
    * non-linear fitting in R (b/a)
    * Bayesian fitting of simple models (a)

* *Population abundance data analyses:* These will use VecDyn data
  - Fit statistical models (time series analyses) - basic AR models; time series as regression (including MLR) (b/a)
  - Fit population dynamics models 
    * Likelihood and Bayesian methods (a)
